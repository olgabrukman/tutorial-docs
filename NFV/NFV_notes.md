NFV (Network Function Virtualization)
==========================================
NFV is a network architecture concept. Entire classes of network node functions are virtualized, becoming building blocks that can connect or chain together to create communication services. 
NaaS -Network Connectvity as a service:
	*Manage network itself
	*Provide bandwidth on demand
	*Network abstraction

Sofware can be baught as SaaS (can build private cloud on spec), NaaS is required to connect cloud components.

SDN vs. NFV: Slide 50
SDN - separation of the Network  Control Plane from the Forwarding Plane and where a control plane can control multiple devices. (Slide 65)
SDN is centralization of the network via the separation of control logic to off device compute that enable automation and 
orchestration of network services via open open programmatic interfaces. SDN benifits: efficiency (optimize existing applications, services, and infrastructure), 
scale, innovation/fast delivery of new applications and services. (https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~jain/cse570-13/ftp/m_16sdn.pdf)
SDN prerequsits:
Network virtualization (data center and cloud) - network resources are available on demand.
Orchestration (cloud) -automated arrangement, coordination, and management of complex computer systems, middleware, and services.
Programmable (enterprise) - should be able to change behavior on the fly
Dynamic scaling (cloud)
Automation - minimize manual involvment (troubleshooting, reduce downtime, policy enforcement, provisioning/re-provisioning/segmentation of resources).
